<p>Recently this site has several downtime because I'm moving my server from one to anther. And if you've subscribed my site you'll noticed that all my posts refreshed in your RSS reader. Sorry about that, you can just ignore them, they're all old posts except this one, just a post to let you know that the site is up and runing now, RSS (Atom) feed will also work (I hope).</p>
</section>

<p>So, let me tell you what I did recently:</p>

* Switched from [Linode](http://linode.com/) to [Rackspace](http://www.rackspacecloud.com/), unmanaged cloud server.
* Change CMS from WordPress to [Stacey](http://staceyapp.com/).
* Apache to nginx, nginx to Apache again.
* Deleted almost all my posts, it's brand-new now.
* Categories changed, only four categories now: Project, Artwork, Nootebook and News.
